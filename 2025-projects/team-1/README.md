# Objectives :

1. To measure differences in model prediction accuracy and performance  what is the model performance difference between parameter efficient fine tuning , full fine tuning, and creating a model entirely from scratch.
2.  Discern between fine-tuning techniques, what might produce the best model for a set of downstream tasks.   

# Repository Overview
---
Both approaches will contain more specific documentation within their respective repositories : 
- `/Finetune/pytorchcaney` contains finetuning code
- `/Scratch_Models_Finalized` contains code from models from scratch
- `/Data_Generation` contains directions for generating the dataset
